# Description

This directory contains a library that provides a strategy of combined, synergistic load balancing and loop scheduling and contains simple example application programs that illustrate the use of the library's functionality for one's own application program.


The repository is the open-source version of the closed bitbucket repository for developing code files CkLoop.C and CkLoop.h into Charm++ source code base's subdirectory /src/libs/ck-libs/ckloop to integrate the hybrid static/dynamic scheduling strategy into the files. The code files can placed into the Charm++ source code's subdirectory /src/libs/ck-libs/ckloop and the Charm++ library can then be built on one's machine.
